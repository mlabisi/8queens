## Running 8queens ðŸ’»
### Step One - Get the Source Code
Clone this repository by opening up the command line and running the following:
```shell script
mkdir 8queens
git clone https://github.com/mlabisi/8queens.git
cd 8queens
```

### Step Two - Install `npm`
Make sure you have `npm` installed on your laptop! You can install it by going to the [official site](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

### Step Three - Install Dependencies
Now that you've installed the package manager, you're ready to install dependencies!  You can do so by simply typing `npm install` in the 8queens directory.
> Dependencies are the `npm` packages that our project depends on. The `project.json` file contains a list of all of the dependencies for our project, but it doesnâ€™t actually install them--we need to run the `npm install` command.

### Step Four - Run The App Locally
Now that the dependencies have been installed, you can run 8queens locally! To do so, go ahead and use this command: `npm run start`.

## Interacting with the GUI ðŸ•¹
The 8queens GUI is very simple. Use the radio buttons on the right-hand side of the screen to select the algorithm you'd like to run.

### Branch or Bound
![branch or bound demo](misc/bb.gif)
> This optimization-based algorithm places the queens on the board randomly, one per column. The algorithm then works to reduce the number of pairs of attacking queens. 


### Hill Climbing
![hill climbing demo](misc/hc.gif)
> Using the concept of the global optimum, this algorithm starts with one queen per column, then moves queens one at a time, each one within its own column.
_If the algorithm gets stuck at the local optimum, a new random state will be generated and the process will repeat._

### Genetics
![genetics demo](misc/ge.gif)
> Based on the theory of evolution and natural selection, this algorithm introduces the concepts of populations, generations, and mutations in order to implement a "survival-of-the-fittest" strategy. The most optimal successor is chosen for each generation.
